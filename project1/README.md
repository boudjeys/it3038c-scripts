# Project Name: FindLargeFile

## Overview
For my project, I developed a Python script that efficiently finds the largest file in a given directory. This script is a handy tool for managing and organizing files, especially when you want to identify and work with the largest files within a directory.

## Credits
I want to acknowledge the helpful resources that contributed to the development of this script:

- **Medium Article:** The script is inspired by a Medium article titled ["Python: Find the Largest File in a Directory"](https://medium.com/@technicadil_001/python-find-the-largest-file-in-a-directory-4bedf0802d77). The article provided valuable insights and guidance on the core logic behind identifying the largest file in a directory.
