# Tetris Game

## Description
This is a simple implementation of the classic game Tetris using Python and Pygame. In Tetris, the player controls falling pieces (tetrominoes) and must rotate and move them to create complete horizontal lines. When a line is complete, it disappears, and the player scores points.

## How to Play
- **Controls:**
  - Left Arrow: Move the piece left
  - Right Arrow: Move the piece right
  - Down Arrow: Move the piece down faster
  - Spacebar: Rotate the piece
  - R: Restart the game (after Game Over)

- **Objective:**
  - The goal is to complete as many horizontal lines as possible to score points.
  - When a line is completed, it disappears, and the player's score increases.
  - The game ends when the falling pieces reach the top of the screen.

- **Scoring:**
  - Clearing one line: 100 points
  - The game speed increases as the score goes up.
