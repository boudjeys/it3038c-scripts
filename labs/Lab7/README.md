# Image Processing Script

This Python script demonstrates basic image processing using the Pillow library. It includes three examples:

1. Converting a JPG image to PNG.
2. Rotating an image 90 degrees.
3. Applying a Gaussian blur to an image.

## Installation

Before running the script, you need to install the required module using pip:

```bash
To install the Pillow Module, run the following commands:

python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install --upgrade Pillow
```

## Usage

You can run the script by executing the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
python boudjeysLab7.py
```

The script will process the images located in the specified directories and save the processed images in the same directories.

##Example
Here's how you can run the script using the provided sample script and images:

```bash
python image_processing.py
```
This will execute the script and perform the image processing operations on the example images in the specified directories, such as converting "bear.jpg" to "bear.png," rotating "fish.jpg" and saving it as "fishrotated.jpg," and applying a Gaussian blur to "squirrel.jpg" and saving it as "squirrelblurred.jpg."
