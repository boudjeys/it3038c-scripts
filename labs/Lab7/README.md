# Image Processing Script

This Python script demonstrates basic image processing using the Pillow library. It includes three examples:

1. Converting a JPG image to PNG.
2. Rotating an image 90 degrees.
3. Applying a Gaussian blur to an image.

## Installation

Before running the script, you need to install the required module using pip:

```bash
To install the Pillow Module, run the following commands:

python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install --upgrade Pillow
```

## Usage

You can run the script by executing the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
python script_name.py
```
Replace script_name.py with the name of your Python script file.

The script will process the images located in the specified directories and save the processed images in the same directories.
